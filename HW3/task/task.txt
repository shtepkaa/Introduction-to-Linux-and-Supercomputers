One advanced programmer has been preparing 2 mini-project libraries (assignment3.zip) and stored their codes at

src1/

and

src2/

folders.

This programmer decided to organize 2 static libraries from the source codes and store them at

libs/

folder.

He has also prepared appropriate main source-code files for the preparation of executables as

main1.c and main2.c

main1.c -- should call only functions from the library from src1/

main2.c -- should call only functions from the library from src2/

Suddenly, include directives, compilation scripts, and Makefile were lost!
Help him to restore the project and create the 2 executables out of main1.c and main2.c for his project.


(2 pts) 1) Restore the #include directives lost at source code files. Leave the comments about the placement of includes.

(2 pts) 2) Prepare the 2 static libraries and save them at libs/ folder

(3 pts) 3) Prepare bash-script with commands allowing the user to prepare the libraries and compile the final project

(3 pts) 4) Prepare Makefile with several targets
-- Target 1 -- compiles the whole project (libraries and executables)
-- Target 2 -- compiles only the project of main1.c with library from src1
-- Target 3 -- compiles only the project of main2.c with library from src2
-- Target 4 -- removes executables, object files, and libraries (if they exist)

Tips:
For call of sin and cos functions use -lm compiler's flag
